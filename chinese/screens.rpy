It always looking toward the future and ways to improve the lives of it's citizens.\nIts land are filled with moutains, crags, caves, forests, and grasslands. It's lands are a treasure trove for ores and stone.\n\nBraum is a nation of antiquity and religion. It's citizens hold great value in time-honored traditions and the secrets of the past.\nWide open fields of greens and golds and dense forests cover the land. Its soil is rich and perfect for farming.\n\nFarhoron is a nation of freedom and chaos. It's citizens live each day as though it were the last in this harsh land.\nThe most varied of the three nations. Deserts, swamps, thick rainforest, deep valleys, and icey\nmountain ranges are left untamed and unexplored for many adventurers who dare explore its vast expanse."

It is filled with\nanimals that roam the land and birds that soar through the air. Tiny insects that burrow\nunderground and in trees, and creatures of the sea, many of which are to be discovered.\nBut one thing that has always been a bit of a mystery were beastmen.\n\nJust who are they? Philosophers, biologists, and scientists through the years have scratched\ntheir heads at the mystery of these people. They have the same physiology as humans yet they\nexhbit the same traits as animals. Many of speculated that beastmen are humans who long\nago dabbled in black magic becoming the beings they are today. But others believe that it is\nwe humans who came from them. Or perhaps it was animals who somehow evolved into them?\n\nNevertheless they are here to stay. The mystery of who beastman really are may never be\nsolved but there is one thing known for sure. That there presence in recorded history extends just as far back as humans."

Yet even as decades past.\nIt did not.\n\nDuring the last war, a great quake shook the entire world and from the settling of the dust\na great wall appeared. It extended from sea to sea and seperated the three nations from one\nanother. Its sheer size and hieght made climbing over it fatal and for many years the world\nremained seggregated. Eventually, people began to tunnel through, inch by inch, foot by foot,\nand the nations were evetually once again connected.\n\nWith the passing of time trade and travel began again between the nations, but kept under\nstrict regulations that eventually gave rise to illegal activities such as smuggling and\ntrafficking.
